Image Processing 
This repository contains a Python script for image processing using the OpenCV and scikit-image libraries. The script performs various image processing tasks, such as thresholding, filtering, and contour extraction. Below is an overview of the functionalities implemented in the script.

Functions
Thresholding
In the script, thresholding is applied using Otsu's method. The image is loaded, converted to grayscale, and then thresholded to create a binary image.

Filtering
A function filter_image is defined to filter an image based on a given mask. The script uses this function to filter the loaded image using the binary image obtained from the thresholding step.

K-Means Clustering
The script demonstrates K-Means clustering on the input image. The image is reshaped and converted into a 3D array, and then K-Means clustering is applied to segment the image into k clusters.

Contour Extraction
The script performs contour extraction on the input image. It converts the image to grayscale, applies thresholding, and detects contours using the Canny edge detector. The largest contour is then used to create a mask, and the original image is masked to extract the region of interest.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your image processing needs!
